# Predictor of interesting matches

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/YozhikM/football.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

The predictor is written using the React library. This small application was created to simplify the task of determining the matches that I will be looking at the weekend.

## Usage

1. `git clone https://github.com/YozhikM/football.git`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm start` *or* `yarn start`
4. `npm test` *or* `yarn test`
